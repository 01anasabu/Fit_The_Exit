# Fit-The-Exit - Customer Drop-Off Analytics

Fit-The-Exit is an intelligent, agentic pipeline that autonomously analyzes website customer interaction data, generates actionable insights in real-time, and enables rapid data-driven decision-making with minimal human intervention.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Traditional analytics methods are:
- Time-consuming and resource intensive.
- Manual, leading to delayed insights and missed optimization opportunities.
- Ineffective in uncovering deep behavioral patterns, causing unexplained visitor drop-offs.

---

## 🛠️ Approach

Fit-The-Exit uses an advanced **LLM-powered multi-agent system** where each agent specializes in a specific function:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and structures raw website interaction data.
- **Column Recommendation Agent**: Selects relevant columns for analysis.
- **Customer Journey Agent**: Maps detailed user navigation patterns.
- **Device Analyzer Agent**: Identifies user device types.
- **Traffic Analyzer Agent**: Analyzes traffic sources.
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Consolidates outputs into a comprehensive report.

Agents work autonomously but collaborate to generate rich, actionable insights.
